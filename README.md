# American Labor Unions under Neoliberalism: A Visual History

Welcome! You are about to explore how the economic conditions of the last 40 years have affected America's diverse workforce and its trade unions. Central topics include trade union density trajectory, real wages, strikes, poverty rates, and educational attainment across geographies, demographics, and industries.

## Overview
All charts, reports, and presentations were created with **R** and use data from federal and international statistical agencies. Each report or presentation follows this structure:
1. **Accessing the Data** - Steps to retrieve the raw figures with links to their respective databases; sometimes includes conceptual definitions, caveat explainers, and calculation guides
2. **Visualization** - Interactive or static charts
3. **Discussion** - Additional economic, historical, or legal context and more in-depth commentary for the Visualization section
4. **Works Cited** - References to secondary sources mentioned in the Discussion segment

## Purpose
In the interest of advancing scientific inquiry and social awareness, I expect visitors to use this site in three ways:
1. **Educational and Professional Use** - Learn about American labor history and share its findings with the broader public. Draw inspiration for your data visualizations at work or school
2. **Advancing Research** - Adapt the project's data or charts non-commercially for related academic and professional investigations (with attribution). Add to this project directly by gathering data and publishing visualizations that fill the gaps between reports.
3. **Enacting Policy** - Quality data analysis translates into actionable results. *American Labor Unions* has information that is valuable to many public and private institutions. If you wish to transform the reports in this project into a plan to improve working conditions, please contact me and I would be more than happy to assist.

Please do not limit the above actions to the US. If there is a dearth of data analysis on industrial relations in your country, go forth and collect the data that will produce accurate and insightful visualizations on the topic. Hopefully, you can teach me what you have learned on that journey.
Keep in mind, the charts show more than just numbers; they display events that were led by American workers or imposed on them. As such, I expect the highest scientific and academic integrity when executing investigations inspired by this project or adding to this project. The subtitle "A Visual History" exists to faithfully commemorate those who participated in industrial actions across the US.
